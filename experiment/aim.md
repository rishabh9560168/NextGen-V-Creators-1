## To implement and verify the functioning of basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT) and to construct digital circuits based on a given Boolean expression using both Sum of Products (SOP) and Product of Sums (POS) forms. The objective is to understand logic simplification, truth table generation, and circuit behavior through virtual simulation.
