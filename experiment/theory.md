# Theory: Logic Gates Implementation (SOP/POS Form)

## Objective
To understand and implement digital logic circuits using the Sum of Products (SOP) and Product of Sums (POS) forms of Boolean expressions through interactive simulation.

---

## Introduction

Digital logic design forms the foundation of modern computing systems. Logic gates are basic building blocks used to create complex circuits. The logical behavior of digital circuits can be described using Boolean algebra, and two standard forms used in implementation are:

- **Sum of Products (SOP)**
- **Product of Sums (POS)**

In this simulation, users will convert a given Boolean expression into a circuit using logic gates (AND, OR, NOT) and verify the results through interactive testing and truth table comparison.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Boolean Algebra
A mathematical technique to represent logic operations. It uses binary variables (0 and 1) and logic operations such as AND (Â·), OR (+), and NOT (').

### 2. SOP (Sum of Products)
In SOP, individual terms (products using AND) are combined using OR operations.

**Example:**  
`F = A'B + AB'`  
Here, the expression includes two product terms (A'B and AB') summed together.

### 3. POS (Product of Sums)
In POS, individual terms (sums using OR) are combined using AND operations.

**Example:**  
`F = (A + B)(A' + B')`  
Here, the expression includes two sum terms multiplied together.

## Implementation Strategy

### SOP Form
- Convert Boolean expression into AND-OR format.
- Each minterm corresponds to an AND gate.
- Outputs of all AND gates are connected to a single OR gate.

### POS Form
- Convert Boolean expression into OR-AND format.
- Each maxterm corresponds to an OR gate.
- Outputs of all OR gates are connected to a single AND gate.

## Simulation Workflow

1. **Select Logic Form**: SOP or POS.
2. **Input Boolean Expression**: User enters the desired Boolean equation.
3. **Expression Parser**: Internally converts and simplifies the expression.
4. **Gate Conversion**: Maps the simplified form to gate-level schematic.
5. **Interactive Circuit Rendering**: Circuit is displayed using simulated logic gates.
6. **User Interaction**: User toggles input switches (0/1).
7. **Output Display**: Real-time output is shown.
8. **Truth Table**: Compares simulated output with theoretical values.
9. **Explanation**: Step-by-step breakdown and optional voice/text guidance.
