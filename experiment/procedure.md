### Procedure
The aim of this experiment is to understand and implement logic gate circuits using Sum of Products (SOP) and Product of Sums (POS) forms, derived from a given truth table. Below is a step-by-step procedure:

1. Analyze the Problem Statement
i.Understand the number of input variables (e.g., A, B, C).

ii.Obtain or construct the truth table for the given Boolean function.

2. Derive the SOP Expression
i.Identify the output rows where the output is 1.

ii.Write the minterms for those rows (each input is written as itself if 1, or complemented if 0).

iii.Form the SOP expression by ORing all the minterms.

Example: If output is 1 for inputs A=0, B=1, C=1 → minterm = A'BC
SOP = A'BC + AB'C + ABC

3. Derive the POS Expression
i.Identify the output rows where the output is 0.

ii.Write the maxterms for those rows (each input is written as itself if 0, or complemented if 1).

iii.Form the POS expression by ANDing all the maxterms.

Example: If output is 0 for A=1, B=0, C=1 → maxterm = (A' + B + C')
POS = (A' + B + C')(A + B + C')

4. Simplify the Boolean Expression
(Optional) Use Boolean algebra or Karnaugh Map (K-map) to simplify the SOP and POS expressions.

5. Implement the SOP Form
i.Use basic logic gates: AND, OR, and NOT.

ii.For each minterm:

  * Use NOT gates for complemented variables.

   * Use AND gates to combine variables for each minterm.

iii.Finally, use an OR gate to combine all minterms.

6. Implement the POS Form
i.Use basic logic gates: AND, OR, and NOT.

ii.For each maxterm:

* Use NOT gates for complemented variables.

* Use OR gates to form each maxterm.

iii.Finally, use an AND gate to combine all maxterms.

7. Connect and Simulate the Circuit
i.Connect inputs to logic gate structures according to the SOP/POS form.

ii.Simulate or test the circuit by applying all combinations of inputs (truth table entries).

iii.Observe the output for each input set.

8. Verify Output
i.Compare the simulated output with the original truth table.

ii.Ensure the output matches for all input combinations in both SOP and POS implementations.

9. Conclusion
i.Understand the structural difference between SOP and POS circuits.

ii.Learn the practical use of Boolean simplification and logic gate minimization.
