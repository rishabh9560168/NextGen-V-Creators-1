# ðŸ§ª Logic Gates Implementation (SOP/POS form) â€“ Procedure

This document outlines the step-by-step procedure to simulate the Logic Gates Implementation in SOP and POS forms in the Virtual Lab environment.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To implement and simulate logic gates using Boolean expressions in Sum of Products (SOP) and Product of Sums (POS) forms, and visualize the output through interactive gate-level diagrams and truth tables.

---

## ðŸ§° Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of logic gates: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR
- Understanding of SOP and POS forms
- Familiarity with Boolean expressions
- A modern browser (for running simulations)

---

## ðŸ§ª Simulation Procedure

### Step 1: **Launch Simulation**
Open the simulation page from the virtual lab homepage or GitHub deployment link.

---

### Step 2: **Choose Logic Form**
Select the desired logic form:
- `SOP` â€“ Sum of Products
- `POS` â€“ Product of Sums

---

### Step 3: **Enter Boolean Expression**
Input a valid Boolean expression in the selected form.  
**Example SOP:** `A'B + AB'`  
**Example POS:** `(A + B)(A' + B')`

---

### Step 4: **Parse and Simplify**
The simulation will parse and simplify the Boolean expression to prepare it for gate-level implementation.

---

### Step 5: **Auto-Generate Circuit**
The simulator automatically generates a logic gate schematic corresponding to the expression:
- SOP: OR-AND structure
- POS: AND-OR structure

---

### Step 6: **Interactive Circuit Simulation**
- Users can toggle input values (0 or 1)
- Observe real-time changes in output
- Truth table updates dynamically with every change

---

### Step 7: **Display of Truth Table**
The simulation shows a full truth table for the given expression, highlighting the current state.

---

### Step 8: **View Explanation**
 Textual and/or voice-guided explanation is available for:
- Expression simplification
- Gate conversion logic
- Working of the circuit

---

### Step 9: **Reset or Try Another**
You may reset the inputs or go back to enter a new SOP/POS expression and simulate again.
